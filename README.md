Astronomy Picture of the Day Search

I based the idea of ​​the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day capstone project on that precisely, "the universe" and the colors that may be most related to it. that's why the dark blue colors, and to contrast the letter the orange and white. I chose that type of font because it is clear when reading and can be understood quite well with dark backgrounds. I feel that despite being dark tones, the colors contrast quite well and so does the choice of images.
